			<h2>Historical Background</h2>
			<p>We begin with a moment in literary history—the stuff of legend perhaps—and so, Los Angeles, 1966. John Martin, then the manager of an office supply company, encountered the poetry of the not-yet infamous Charles Bukowski in a small literary magazine. Impressed by the brutal immediacy of the writing, Martin set out cross-town to track down the would-be poet and hard-edged postal employee, and found him, at home, many beers into his Saturday morning. As the story goes, Bukowski invited Martin inside, and offered him a drink. Martin turned down the drink—much to the poet’s displeasure—but asked if Bukowski could show him any work that he had yet to publish. Bukowski gestured towards a nearby closet, where a growing pile of manuscripts awaited Martin’s perusal. Having briefly looked the manuscripts over, and suitably engaged, Martin offered Bukowski $100 per month if he would quit his postal job and become a full time writer. Bukowski, whose rent at the time was a mere $37 per month, agreed and Martin, selling his collection of D.H. Lawrence first editions for a cool $50,000, founded the Black Sparrow Press.</p>

			<p>Black Sparrow went on to become one of the most important small, private avant-garde presses on the west coast of the United States—in part, thanks to sales of Bukowski’s work—and endured as a thriving enterprise for thirty-six years, with offices located in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and finally Santa Rosa, California. In May, 2002, Martin closed up shop, selling the rights to his premier authors (Bukowski, Bowles, and Fante) to HarperCollins; the Wyndam Lewis titles went to Ginkgo Press in Corte Madera, while the balance of the list was purchased by Boston publisher Charles Godine. This was, indeed, the end of an era in small press history. With an eclectic eye for the up-and-coming, Martin published the work of many important poets of the late twentieth-century, including Denise Levertov, Robert Duncan, John Ashbery, Diane Wakoski, Charles Reznikoff, Louis Zukofsky, Robert Creeley, Ed Dorn, Kenneth Koch, Daphne Marlatt, Jackson Mac Low, David Bromige—the list goes on, and on. In its earliest, most precarious days, Black Sparrow survived without the help of outside financial assistance, and Martin managed to make each book pay for the next. The volumes were typically produced in limited numbers (a run of 250 was not uncommon); wrapper editions were priced as high as $10.00, while special hardcover editions (which often included original artwork by the author or illustrator), sold for prices ranging from $15.00 to $30.00. The result was a high-end series of broadsides, chapbooks, and full-length volumes harbouring some of the most innovative writing of the period, and all creatively designed (by Barbara Martin), meticulously printed (by either Saul and Lillian Marks of Plantin Press, or more often by printers Philip Klein, Noel Young, or Graham Mackintosh) and beautifully bound (by the Earle Gray Bookbinding Company). This collective effort was a much-heralded success: Black Sparrow Press editions, it might be argued, represent some of the most remarkable examples of fine press work in the late twentieth-century.</p>
			<h2>Provenance of the Archive</h2>
			<p>John Martin’s financial shrewdness extended to the insight that the papers and other material artifacts associated with his publications were themselves a substantial asset. With that in mind, he meticulously accumulated the materials related to each book publication, tailored the files to meet scholarly expectations, and then put the entire collection up for sale. “Please,” wrote Martin in a 1968 note to printer Noel Young, “guard these page proofs and the original ms with your very life!” In July, 1969 the University of Alberta Library and Department of English responded to this savvy business gesture—at the invitation of International Bookfinders of Beverly Hills, California—by agreeing to purchase the first sixty-two files for the sum of $23,000, and subsequent files for an additional $200 each (all figures in U.S. funds).</p>

			<p->Unfortunately, in December, 1970, and after the purchase of only an additional thirty-two files, the Department of English Library Committee declined any further purchases on the grounds of “economic stringency and continuing acquisitions requirements in other areas,” while contending that the institution had been burdened with “subsidizing” the operations of the press—a claim to which Martin strongly objected. In a letter gracefully protesting this decision, he called this conclusion both “amazing” and “astounding” and contested its veracity on the grounds that the $200 fee barely offset the $3,000-$5,000 cost of producing each volume. A request from Martin that he be permitted to buy back the archive for resale to another institution was denied.</p>

			<p>The balance of the Black Sparrow Archive can now be located at a number of other institutions across North America, as the University of Alberta’s inability to maintain its financial commitment to the collection has been proven the rule rather than the exception. Further Black Sparrow Press materials are held at the Special Collections Department of Pennsylvania State University (1967-1974); the Center for Southwest Research at the University of New Mexico (1967-1975); Special Collections at the University of Arizona (1973-1993), and the University of California at Berkeley (1993-present).</p>
			<h2>Contents of the Archive</h2>
			<p>The materials collected under the Black Sparrow fond include manuscript drafts, typescripts, corrected proofs and galleys, correspondence between publisher, printers, illustrators and authors, original artwork, photographs, master reel-to-reel recordings, various peripheral materials including colophon and title page printing blocks, and signed wrapper, hardcover, and special hardcover editions. The materials date from those related to the first publication of Bukowski’s broadside True Story in April, 1966 to those related to Gerard Malanga’s volume Ten Poems for Ten Poets, published in November, 1970. These materials have been organized in distinct boxes, each corresponding to one of the first ninety-four publications of the Black Sparrow Press. The materials within those boxes have been organized with respect to the process of book production (ie. beginning with manuscript drafts, design sketches, galleys, etc., and ending with the various states of the first editions). Each box includes a concluding file of related correspondence organized chronologically. Most often the correspondence is from author to publisher—the absence of the publisher’s responding letters creates a sizable gap in the archive—although there are noteworthy exceptions to this tendency. There are 1008 records in all, each detailing the materials that appear in a variety of distinct media. There are, furthermore, two appendices to the archive as a whole. Appendix One includes reviews, notices, and mentions; Appendix Two includes promotional flyers, brochures, 
			and catalogues.</p>
			<h2>The Bibliography Project</h2>
			<p>The Black Sparrow Press archive, housed in Bruce Peel Special Collections at the University of Alberta, has remained only roughly catalogued and largely unexplored for the last three decades. This bibliography seeks to rectify that situation, by making available to researchers a detailed accounting of the materials held therein. The year-long task of organizing the materials, packaging the contents for preservation, and producing an annotated bibliography of the archive began in the summer of 2001. Two previous documents proved to be of considerable help in identifying the contents of the archive: a rough inventory of the archive provided by the Black Sparrow Press at the time of acquisition (here referred to as the “Black Sparrow archive catalogue”) and a guide to first editions of the press titled A Bibliography of the Black Sparrow Press, 1966-1978, edited by Bradford Morrow and Seamus Cooney. The contents of the archive were recorded in a database using Procite 5.0 software, which was then converted to print and web-based forms. The bibliography has been arranged, again, in keeping with the ninety-four publications of the press, although online search functions and numerous instances of cross referencing should make it possible for researchers to locate all materials of import to any given research project. While the printed bibliography (in an issue of 250 copies), has been made available to interested institutions, the online database (linked to the Bruce Peel Special Collections website) should serve to make the archive accessible to scholars worldwide.</p>

			<p>It is our hope that this bibliography proves to be both a valuable research guide to the archive, and a signal to other scholars of the wealth of research materials it promises. While certainly no archive comes to us in an unmediated fashion, the Black Sparrow Press archive is, indeed, unusual in that it was deliberately constructed by the publisher for potential buyers. While that fact alone might well throw into question the status of the material archive of late modernism (which takes shape under such economic constraints and with a hyper-awareness of the machinations of literary history), the Black Sparrow Press collection nonetheless affords real opportunities for scholars interested in the socio-economics of small press operations, the history of the book, and the work of the particular writers and poets who contributed to the ongoing vitality of the Black Sparrow Press.</p>
